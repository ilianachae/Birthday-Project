## Function

The aim of project is checking the age based on the date and birthday.

### Legal Age 

The main function is showing the legal age's birthday based on today's date.

### Age Calculator

The second function is age calculator which is able to calculate age based on birthday and specific date. The user able to put any date for two inputs which are start-date(Date-of-Birth) and last-date(Age-at-the-Date).

## Note

I tried to add more functions and fireworks effect would be appeared when the birthday that the user inputs and today's date is same, but I didn't have that much time for adding and figuring out.

So, my next goal would be adding the easter eggs and one more function that able to calculate the left date for next birthday that the user inputs.
